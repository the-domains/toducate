When I was 19, people always told me I reminded them of Jason Priestley.

That blue-eyed charmer from Beverly Hills 90210\.

When I was 29, people often said I reminded them of Edward Norton.

Not a teen idol, but not too shabby either.

Well, now I'm 39...

I was just told by a friend that I reminded them of Don Knotts. Especially when I get really worked up.
