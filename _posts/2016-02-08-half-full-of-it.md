I suspect Annie wants me to quit drinking Diet Mountain Dew. Mostly I think this because I'm really good at reading between the lines and picking up on non-verbal queues. Plus, from time to time she'll say something like,

"Quit drinking Mt. Dew please."

The thing is, she always focuses on how much I drink and insists that anything over 90 fluid ounces per day is excessive. I don't like this 

_glass-is-half-empty_

mentality. I've always preferred to see my glass as half full, especially my glass of sweet & heavenly Mountain Dew. So I've tracked my behavior and crunched some numbers. What I've discovered through research and science has been surprising.

**Scientific\* Research Findings:**

During an average 24 hour period I'm actually not directly drinking a Diet Mountain Dew 96.3% of the time.

_\*validity pending the official definition of the word scientific_

Wow! I'm as shocked by the findings as you are.

Turns out 96.3% of the time I'm not drinking a Diet Dew! That's not just the majority of time, it's over 23 hours in one day that I'm not actually sipping this aspartame-infused beverage. If I was a basketball player shooting 96.3% I'd be a hero. If I was an investor that succeeded 96.3% of the time, I'd be filthy rich and rolling in piles of money. If I was a man that still had 96.3% of his hair left, I'd be thrilled, and hairier.

Scientists agree- this glass is actually completely full. Half full of water & half full of air.

But is Annie thrilled with 96.3%? Well, she's yet to see these numbers in black and white. Once she does, I think she'll change her tune. After all, I'm only actually letting a Mountain Dew trickle down my gullet for 1 hour & 50 min each day. That doesn't sound like a problem, that sounds like a gentle supplement to a full day of healthy choices.

Being pleasantly surprised at how easy scientific research is to do all by myself, I decided to round up a few more stats. Here is what I discovered about how great I'm actually doing at living life.

* 99.8% of the time I'm not jaywalking.
* 99.05% of the time I'm not smuggling in "the goods" for drug lords from Bogata or Mexico City, and going by the secret name 'Esa Mula Embalaje Loca'. One that translates to 'the crazy packing mule'. A name that provokes both fear and respect.
* 55.4% of the time I'm not sleeping. That's the majority of my time wide awake and participating in society!
* 92% of the time I'm not saying offensive things about all those crazy women-in-huge-SUVs-that-are-sporting-workout-clothes-but-still-wearing-makeup-and-probably-went-to-the-gym-like-7hours-ago-but-think-they-look-hot-so-they're-still-all-prepped-up-but-I-don't-mean-the-people-I-know-personally-ha-ha-cause-you're-probably-the-exception. Better adjust that to 91% of the time.
* Almost 100% of the time I'm taking in oxygen and getting rid of all excess carbon dioxide. This is a really healthy habit, [says WebMD][0]
* 76% of the time I'm not embarrassing my two kids by singing their names into rhyming jingles. Isn't that right,_Clarky-sparky-full-of-malarky and __Ava-the-babevay-chillin-all-the-dayva?_
* 76.1% of the time that's not done in front of their friends.
* 82% of the time I'm not falsifying data and confusing scientifically-valid research with what some might call 'just a gut feeling'.

After all the number crunching, I feel pretty good about myself and my life choices. Guess I'm a pretty decent guy. I think I'll treat myself to a drink.
